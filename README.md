## Advance solution
Please see the "advance" folder. 

I use modified densenet[1] and obtained **99.40%** on the test set. 
The netowk complexity is about **27.0 million MAC** (Multiplyâ€“accumulate operation counts). 

Here is my network structure. Each "Dense block" consists of concatenation of convolutions (in conv-bn-relu). Note that unlike the paper, dropout is not applied in the block. Instead, I use droupout after the block.

Here is the MAC computation
